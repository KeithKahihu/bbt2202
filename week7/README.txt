=========
[C++ STL]
=========
For each group, come up with:
STL Containers:
---------------
2 simple examples of using 2 STL Containers
expected: 2 code files, each demonstrating the use of an STL
container such-as: std::vector, std::list, std::deque, std::map,
std::set, std::string

Iterators:
----------
2 simple examples of using Iterators (READ-ONLY & READ-WRITE) with
the STL container examples your group came up with above.
expected: 2 code files, each demonstrating the use of STL Iterators.
These could be demonstrated in the same code files above. The
iterators are obtained as shown below:
read-only iterators - [container]::const_iterator
read-write iterators - [container]::iterator

STL Algorithms:
---------------
2 simple examples of using Algorithms with the above STL containers
expected: 2 code files, each demonstrating the use of STL Algorithms.
These could be dmonstrated in the same code files above.
std::find, std::find_if, std::search, std::copy, std::remove_copy,
std::remove_copy_if, std::transform

=================================================================
[Design Patterns] - Choose one pattern to implement in your group
=================================================================
Creational Patterns:
--------------------
Builder: come up with your implementation of an assembly line for
some complex aggregate e.g. Vehicles, Houses, Computers,
Phones/Devices, e.t.c employ your imagination

Behavioural Patterns:
---------------------
Observer: come  up with your own implementation of a scenario where
some object, say `a', is observed by other objects and whenever the
state of `a' changes, those other objects print some message in
response.

Structural Patterns:
--------------------
Flyweight: Employ your imagination.
